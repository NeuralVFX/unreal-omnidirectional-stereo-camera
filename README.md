# Unreal-Omnidirectional-Stereo-Camera

This plugin adds a new Camera Class to Unreal which can be used to render Omnidirectional Stereo Images. 

Rathen than output full images directly, this outputs the array of images plus a TXT file required to make a smoooth stich using "PTStitcher" or "PTMender", similar to what Ansel does behind the scenes.
